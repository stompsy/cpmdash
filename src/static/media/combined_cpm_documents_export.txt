Questions
The implementation of the Post Overdose Response Team represents more than just a shift 
in Community Paramedicine; it's a commitment to transforming lives at a critical juncture. 
By equipping our Community Paramedics with the tools to offer immediate support and 
bridge individuals to longer-term care, we're not just responding to overdoses-we're 
creating pathways toward recovery and hope. Every successful intervention is a step closer 
to reducing the toll of Opioid Use Disorder in our community. Thank you for your support of 
this initiative and for helping us redefine what it means to serve and protect in moments of 
crisis.
City Council Presentation (May 20, 2025)
Good evening council,
Back in August of 2023 Council awarded Opioid Settlement Funding to Operation Shielding 
Hope.
The program description included in our grant application stated the following:
Funding this request would enable PAFD and PAPD to outfit Community Resource 
personnel with the necessary tools, equipment, and specialized training in Substance Use 
Disorder and Behavioral Health Crisis Care.  A 2021 Prehospital Emergency Care article 
reported that nearly one-third of individuals who experienced an accidental opioid death 
utilized 911 Emergency Medical Services before their fatal overdose.
The article also identifies individuals having experienced a non-fatal opioid overdose at an 
increased risk of death within one year.  Equipping the Port Angeles Community Medics 
with emergency response capable units, equipment and training to respond to overdose-
related incidents and provide point-of-care support, education, and referral services would 
lead to a reduction in repeat overdoses, a reduction in opioid overdose deaths, and an 
increase in the availability of Port Angeles Fire units for additional emergency responses.
Collaboration and coordination between the Port Angeles Community Medics and the PAPD 
Resource Officer could lead to pre-overdose interventions for high-risk populations and a 
reduced stigma surrounding opioid rehabilitation services.
Funding Operation Shielding Hope would equip outreach specialists not tied to the next 911 
dispatch and enable them to establish trusted and meaningful relationships with 
community members, business owners and individuals affected by Opioid Use Disorder, 
thus further reducing the impact to the city and its citizens.
At the time of our application the Port Angeles Fire Department and Port Angeles Police 
Department was responding to greater than 4 overdoses per week.  Clallam County had the 
4th highest overdose fatality rate in the state at 55.7 deaths per 100,000 population.  And 
according to an earlier report from Clallam County Health and Human Services greater than 
70% of all county overdoses were occurring in the city of Port Angeles.
By January of 2024 Clallam County would reach the number two position for the highest 
overdose fatality rate in the state at 70.7 deaths per 100,000.
And by March of 2024 the county would record an overdose fatality rate 73.3 deaths per 
100,000.  The challenges Public Safety faced during this time included a greater than 60% 
overdose survivor refusal for treatment and transport.
You see...often crews would arrive and find that the overdose survivor had been given 
upwards of 16 mg's of Narcan - four times the commonly recommended dose.  Survivor's 
were literally walking away from EMS crews upon their arrival...which eliminated any 
opportunity to refer patients to Substance Use Disorder Services available throughout the 
city.  This led to frequent repeat overdoses, which impacted crews in the form of 
compassion fatigue... as they wrestled with the inability to help a demographic who simply 
refused assistance.
The main goal of Operation Shielding Hope included the enhancement and expansion of 
services from the Port Angeles Fire Department and Port Angeles Police Department to 
effectively address the high volume of overdoses occurring within the city.
We hypothesized that many of the overdose survivor's were refusing treatment and 
transport because the high doses of Narcan were sending them into Precipitated 
Withdrawal.  The severity of the withdrawal symptoms then became the survivor's 
immediate focus... which often led them to refuse treatment and transport...in order to 
address the withdrawal symptoms the only way they knew how to...by using again.
We believed that if we could intervene at the time of the overdose by effectively treating 
precipitated withdrawal through the administration of Buprenorphine we could reduce 
repeat overdoses and equally important... establish a rapport with overdose survivor's 
...ultimately gaining their trust and eventually obtaining their consent for referral to 
Substance Use Disorder services.
In January of 2024 Port Angeles Fire Department petitioned the Washington State 
Department of Health for approval of a 2-Year pilot program to establish a Post Overdose 
Response Unit and expand the Scope of Practice for the department's two Community 
Paramedics.
In February the department utilized Opioid Settlement funding to equip Port Angeles 
Community Paramedics with emergency response capable units.
In March the department received approval from Washington DOH to implement a Post 
Overdose Response Team and expand the scope of practice for Community Paramedics.  
With DOH approval Community Paramedics began responding to all 911 dispatched 
overdoses while on duty.  Port Angeles Police Department Community Resource Officer 
began working closely with Port Angeles Fire Department Community Paramedics.
In April we implemented a referral program so that on duty shift personnel could refer 
overdose survivor's to the Community Paramedic Office for all overdoses that occurred 
outside the Community Medic working hours.
Lessons Learned in the First Months
*	Community Medics responded to 23 overdoses while on duty
*	18 of the 23 overdose survivors accepted referrals to Substance Use Disorder 
services
*	Greater than 78% linkage to SUD services occurred when CPM's respond to 
overdose incidents
*	A stigma surrounding Buprenorphine limited administration in the field
*	Only a 3% success rate of linking overdose survivor's to SUD services when 
Community Paramedics were out of the office
*	The most critical aspect was actually the arrival of CPM's, facilitating a warm 
handoff
In June of 2024 Port Angeles Fire received a $350,000 grant from the University of 
Washington and the Co-responder Outreach Alliance.
*	Added two community EMT's to the Community Paramedic Office
*	Established two autonomous Post Overdose Response Units
*	Broadened the 911 Emergency Services response capability
Impact of Operation Shielding Hope
*	By January 2025, Clallam County dropped from 2nd to 10th in overdose fatality rate 
(from 73.3 to 41.2 deaths per 100,000)
*	By March 2025, further dropped to 11th and 34.8 deaths per 100,000 (63% 
decrease in fatal overdoses in 12 months)
Program Successes
*	70%+ acceptance into MOUD and MAT services when Community Paramedics 
provide a warm handoff
*	100% of 911-dispatched overdoses outside CPM hours are referred to Community 
Medics for follow-up
*	Only 3% linkage to services when Community Paramedics do not respond
*	CPM's serve as the linkage hub in the community-wide response
*	REdisCOVERY: 70%+ connection to services, 132 out of county transports (99% 
connection to services)
*	Collaboration with multiple agencies: Reflections Counseling, PHB Reel Teams, 
NOHN, Jamestown Healing Center, OMC, Clallam County Jail MOUD, Health and 
Human Services, Harm Reduction Center, Narcan Distribution
We appreciate your continued support and celebrate the successful impact Operation 
Shielding Hope is having on the city's Opioid Crisis.

Prevention & Health Education
Through home visits, telehealth appointments, and telephone check-ins, Community 
Paramedics can identify medication errors, environmental risks, or problems with durable 
medical equipment that are not often identified in a traditional clinical or healthcare setting.
Improve Access to Primary Care
Community Paramedics deliver basic primary care services in the patient's home, ensure 
prompt care and identify health issues that need to be escalated to another provider, and 
facilitate communication between patients and their primary care providers.
Post-Discharge Follow-Up Care
Decrease 30-day readmissions and preventable hospital visits by assisting patients in 
adapting to their new health regimens. In instances where a patient cannot be seen by a 
home health agency promptly, Community Paramedics can bridge the gap and provide 
timely support.
Reducing Use of EMS / ED Services
In rural communities with limited EMS and ED capacity, community paramedicine can be 
employed to achieve two goals: conserve resources for emergent issues, and provide more 
cost-effective, beneficial care to patients.
Referrals for Social Services
Community Paramedics often provide support to patients through care navigation and 
linkage to the social services sector. They can ask questions or identify issues that are 
otherwise not visible to a provider in a clinic, but which may have an impact on the patient's 
health and well-being.
