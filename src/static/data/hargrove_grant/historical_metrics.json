We are participating in educational opportunities that target vulnerable populations. We are currently focused on the mental health aspect.

With Clallam Care Connection (3C), we are working to further strengthen and implement policies to assist multi-agency patients. The Clallam Health Department has taken over the 3C group, allowing a more HIPPA-protected and streamlined exchange of information between agencies involved in the collaborative. In the first quarter, we became involved in discussions with the goal of establishing a Medical Respite Program - a collaboration between CCC, Serenity House, OMC, NOHN, the Health Department, PAFD, Olympic Ambulance, and PBH \u0096 to assist vulnerable populations that have been discharged from the hospital but require a safe place to recuperate. We continue to participate in frequent outreach efforts with REdisCOVERY, working to bring medical care and social services to vulnerable and unhoused individuals in our community."

This limited her ability to receive physical therapy/occupational therapy services. Her ongoing discomfort and ability to ambulate resulted in a deterioration of her cognition. Community Paramedicine got involved and were able to transport her to her follow-up appointments with orthopedist and primary care. This resolved a medication issue that had further contributed to her declining mental state. Now she is able to fully ambulate and go on walks, take her trash out, etc., and has has had remarkable improvement in her cognition and emotional state."

This quarter our services have been requested by a variety of new agencies/organizations and we are getting requests for services we have not yet provided. North Olympic Healthcare Network, Peninsula Behavioral Health (PBH), Olympic Medical Center (Olympic Medical Physicians, Cancer Center, Home Health), Elwha Clinic, Jamestown Family Health Clinic, Olympic Peninsula Community Clinic, Olympic Area Agency on Aging are among some of the referral sources. Metrics Beyond what data our partners and grantors request from us, we are able to break down our referrals into other important areas and track age, sex, programs patients belong to in the community, patients w/ substance use disorders, types of procedures and/or services provided, etc. This allows us to visualize what services are being used and revise our Community Paramedicine program to address these areas more efficiently. We have recently implemented a way to query and track hospital admissions for our patients. This helps us to better understand the vulnerable populations we serve. Until now our focus has been on providing better access to care and reducing 911 and Emergency Department usage. With these numbers we are able to explain to our providers, partners, and community members that some of these \"High Utilization\" patients are being admitted to the hospital after being transported to the emergency department. It gives us insight into the complexity of the chronically ill patients."

Clallam County does not currently have this service available. The lack of this service became even more apparent in late 2021 when our hospital systems were overwhelmed responding to COVID and there was an increased urgency for discharging patients whose discharge was delayed due to lack of secure housing. PAFD Community Paramedics are collaborating with Clallam County Health and Human Services, Serenity House of Clallam County, Olympic Medical Center, North Olympic Healthcare Network, and Olympic Peninsula Community Clinic to establish a Medical Respite Program. This program will provide the infrastructure to treat patients in place at the shelter. More importantly, it is a safe discharge option allowing vulnerable populations convalescence in a SNF or LTCF."

We will be participating in two regional action collaboratives to improve access to care for vulnerable populations and destigmatize substance use disorder. We are still looking for alternate sources of funding. We continue to appeal to the City of Port Angeles for funding. While we do not bring any money (besides grant funds to pay our wages) to the City, we do save a tremendous amount of money to the City and it's taxpayers."

She is not a difficult patient and requires very little support, but without it she deteriorates rapidly. We switched her from managing her own medications to getting them from the pharmacy at Peninsula Behavioral Health. She has to walk from her apartment to the pharmacy to get them every day except weekends. She has lost 38 lbs. in the past six months. She has been clean and recovering from Methamphetamine abuse for 8 months. She calls us several times a week for advice. She just needs a little bit of reassurance and this keeps her from calling 911 and visiting the Emergency Department for minor things."

          "response": "We have re-modelled our Community Paramedic data collection tool & database. In the past we have had to spend a tremendous amount of time breaking the data into their atomic parts. It is now completely automated. The database is relational and is much easier to run complex queries on. We did not anticipate this would be necessary until the program evolved and we began offering more procedures to patients. It also helps us decide what is helping patients the most. We are now able to track patient demographics, referrals per patient, and encounters per patient. We can then break down every encounter by type (anti-psychotic injection, treat & release, transport, vaccination, blood draw, track meetings, etc). Another fantastic use for this is by assigning times to each enounter so that we can produce a report for unit/time utilization. The other providers within the fire department can refer patients to us at any time during their shift and they can follow up to get an idea of what's been done for the patient."

Each quarter she will be taking our patient set and calculating Emergency Department and readmission activity for these patients for us. This action takes an enormous amount of time for Community Paramedics and this helps us tremendously so we spend our time addressing patients needs. We continue to provide COVID-19 and Influenza boosters to Long-term Care Facilities and homebound patients as well as the City of Port Angeles staff members. Our vaccination numbers are rising again as the new bivalent booster is available through Clallam County Health Department. We are in the process of introducing Community Paramedics to advocating for SUD patients in court. Currently, Peninsula Behavioral Health will send a provider to assess patients as they are our area's BHASO. While the City of Port Angeles is committed to helping people get off the streets, engage with services, and enter recovery programs, we feel that more could be done to achieve this. Testifying in court on behalf of patients experiencing SUD or homelessness will be one step closer to definitive care."

We will be purchasing an I-Stat machine (with Chem8+ cartridges) which will give us the ability to further improve our in-home evaluation of chronic patients. With i-STAT CHEM8+, healthcare professionals can obtain chemistries, electrolytes, hematocrit and hemoglobin levels in approximately two minutes without leaving the patient's side. Incorporating i-STAT CHEM8+ early in the patient experience may help transform the delivery of care by empowering you to accelerate clinical decision-making and increase operational efficiency and reduce the total cost of care. The i-STAT CHEM8+ cartridge can be used to rapidly assess the metabolic status of patients in a variety of clinical settings including critical care, surgery, radiology, acute and emergency care, and community-based settings. Specifically, the i-STAT Chem 8+ measures Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Chloride (Cl), TCO2, Anion Gap*, Ionized Calcium (iCa), Glucose (Glu), Urea Nitrogen (BUN)/Urea, Creatinine (Crea), Hematocrit (Hct), Hemoglobin* (Hgb). *Calculated\u0094 With these funds we will also be upgrading software on our portable computers giving us the ability to see CAD information from dispatch as it comes in rather than a short message through Active 911 and relying on radio updates."

          "response": "i-STAT 1 Analyzer & Health Data Exchange Software As a result of the OCH grant the Port Angeles Fire Department has been able to purchase the Abbott I-STAT 1 Analyzer, docking station and electronic simulation calibrator.  Additional key implementation accomplishments include approval for use of the I-STAT field blood analyzer by the Clallam County Medical Program Director Danielle Whitley, development of the I-STAT use policies and procedures, training curriculum for new users and purchase of Chem8+ and INR test cartridges.  Currently Port Angeles Fire Department is awaiting the arrival of the Chem8+ and INR cartridges to become fully operational with the I-STAT field blood analyzer program. The range of tests we can perform in the field include blood gases, chemistries and electrolytes, cardiac markers, coagulation, hematology, and endocrinology. While we will still offer blood draws taken to a laboratory, it can sometimes take hours or days for a physician to get results. One example, the i-STAT EC8+ cartridge, returns the following results within two (2) minutes: Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Chloride (Cl), Anion Gap, Glucose (Glu), (BUN)/Urea Nitrogen, Urea, Hematocrit (Hct), Hemoglobin, pH, PCO2, TCO2, HCO3, and Base Excess (BE). Having access to these lab values so quickly allows us to better determine alternative dispositions for our patients. This service is essential during care planning for our homebound patients. It results in better health outcomes for underserved populations and reduces costs related to caring for them. Through the equipping of ruggedized computers with ESO electronic healthcare reporting software the Port Angeles Fire Department is working to enhance our relationship with Olympic Medical Center Emergency Department staff and Medical Records clerks.  ESO\u0092s Health Data Exchange software will enable Community Paramedics and Emergency Services personnel to send reports directly into OMC\u0092s healthcare reporting system as well as receive outcome information.  This software is HIPAA compliant and will greatly enhance Quality Assurance and Quality Improvement programs through the data sharing process. Additionally, placing the ISTAT field blood analyzer in the hands of our Community Paramedics will continue to strengthen our relationships with local health care teams, clinics and primary care physicians. Data Collection As previously reported, we remodeled our database and data collection software. We have a full quarter of expanded data. It is very exciting to visualize this new data as they offer incredible insight into the services we offer. It will help us prepare accurate proposals to submit to agencies we offer services to in order to help make our program sustainable in the future. March 8, 9, 10 we will be educating our crews to use the new software in order to submit referrals to this system. The system is closed-loop and will offer feedback so crews can track progress on their patient referrals. After some testing, our plan is to open this referral system to other agencies. The difficulty in the past has been ensuring this system is HIPAA compliant outside of our own agency. We believe these issues have been addressed."

          "question": "Briefly describe collaborative efforts and outreach activities employing collective impact strategies",
          "response": "The Association of Washington Cities has awarded the City of Port Angeles a grant that will be used to design an alternative response model for behavioral health and SUD-related 911 calls. We will be the first Fire Department in the nation to model a LEAD-like co-responder program. Historically, Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) has existed within Police Departments. We believe the Emergency Medical System is more prepared to respond to calls of this nature and that we can facilitate a more dignified approach to caring for these patients. In many cases, we already do this and have found alternative dispositions improving patient outcomes. An example is a behavioral health emergency. A paramedic and behavioral health professional to evaluate for medical and psychiatric help is a more appropriate response to a mental health crisis than a law enforcement officer. It reduces trauma related to caring for the patient. In many cases these patients end up in jail or a hospital. Alternatively, we can take them to a crisis center for definitive care. In turn, this frees up the law enforcement officer to handle criminal activity and a bed and other resources at the hospital. We are very excited to be a part of this!"

          "question": "Success Stories",
          "response": "Working with a local pharmacy, we have increased availability to Influenza vaccinations tremendously. Our first year of this program we vaccinated roughly 1,000 people against COVID-19 and just three (3) against Influenza. None of the other local pharmacies, clinics, or family physicians had a mechanism in place to vaccinate, or even allow us to vaccinate, homebound patients against anything. A very small number of patients that have been prescribed home health could get vaccinated against Influenza only by a home health nurse during a patient visit with physician's orders. Jim\u0092s Pharmacy allows us to vaccinate the patient while they take care of billing the patient\u0092s insurance company. This has opened up the ability for a physician to refer other types of vaccinations to the Community Paramedicine program. Another success we had this quarter was a case we finally closed with an elderly couple. The couple are in their mid-to-late 80s. Both have severe memory loss. They were living in an apartment with no nearby support from family or friends. One of them is an undocumented immigrant. Access to healthcare, especially medications, was very limited. North Olympic Healthcare Network (NOHN) and Community Paramedicine has been attending to these two patients for the last couple of years. We became involved first with the wife after she had convalesced from an accident that resulted in a broken hip. Later, this patient acquired several infections; UTI, an ear infection that had closed her ear canal completely, and a respiratory infection. Due to her severe memory loss, it was incredibly difficult getting her to take a full course of oral antibiotics to resolve these infections. Working with her physician at NOHN, we were able to continually modify her care plan. There were several changes in antibiotics due to inability to swallow, etc. We were eventually able to take her to (5) short stay appointments at Olympic Medical Center so she could receive IV antibiotics. This resolved these conditions that had been persisting for several months. A couple of months later the husband had a fall and broke his hip and was sent to a convalescent center for rehabilitation. The wife was solely cared for by her husband and living with severe memory problems at home alone. PAFD and PAPD had this patient transported to the hospital where they agreed to keep her in an observation status until her husband was released from physical rehabilitation. Aside from these health-related problems, there were social needs that had to be addressed. We worked with the Canadian Parliament and social workers to find family members. Eventually we learned that there was a family member that had been sending a significant amount of money each month to help toward paying for medications. We contacted this person and they agreed to help pay for assisted living close to their home in Seattle. There are many gaps in our healthcare system. Community Paramedicine is essential in filling these gaps until patients can get definitive care. We have built a wonderful, trusting relationship with our local physicians and behavioral health professionals that work very closely to develop dynamic care plans to fulfill our community\u0092s needs."

          "response": "(4000 character limit) space remaining =   4000 68279 We discussed this item in our last meeting and explained the difficulty in reporting an accurate number. Simply saying we know the referrals are being completed isn't good enough. We are not seeing them as often in the 911 system or in the emergency department. Our partner agencies are getting feedback from the patients. But we don't yet have the capacity to follow up with everyone. We hope that by expanding access to the reporting system we use, expanded access to the Epic network.. and adding additional staff such as a case manager, we will truly have a well-rounded, closed-loop referral system in place. This is a priority item and we are continually working toward a solution!"

This patient was referred to Community Paramedicine by PAFD, NOHN, and OMC ED for having high 911, ED, and Clinical usage. She was admitted during 3 of her prior ED visits. Initially she was calling 911 for minor issues like needing someone to close her fence gate or to check her blood pressure monitor for accuracy. She was also calling her PCP multiple times per day for things like requests for prescription pain medication. She complained frequently that she was being mistreated at the ED and was not being taken seriously by her PCP. Her PCP was overwhelmed with the number of calls and requests from the patient. Community Paramedics worked with each agency to help set up appointments and obtain in-home caregiving services, but the patient continued to cancel all appointments and caregiving services, often the day before they were scheduled. A success came when Community Paramedics determined she may be experiencing side effects from an anti-emetic she was prescribed, worked with her PCP to change her medication, picked the medication up and helped administer it \u0096 all in the same day. The patient avoided calling 911 or visiting the ED for three weeks after that. Challenges: After more than 6 months in the program, the patient began overusing her nausea medication and running out early, which re-initiated her 911 calls and frequent ED utilization. Many months of close contact with family members was unable to change the patient\u0092s behavior. Eventually however, an effective plan was implemented that included more frequent family visits and a reminder that while she could use 911 or the ED for true emergencies, she would incur fines for obstruction for any non-emergency calls/visits, per municipal code enforcement. That motivated her to change her behavior while still getting her needs met. There have been zero 911 calls to this address for two years and only one ED visit in the last two years.

A tentative solution will be migration of data and software to NOHN's tenant. This will allow us and other agencies that have business agreements within Clallam Care Connection (3C) to track our patients and their referrals. We are querying local physician groups to learn how Point of Care Testing might benefit their patients. Our handheld I-Stat device gives us a look at many lab values within a couple of minutes. We also have the ability to test for pregnancy as well as capillary tubes that can analyze blood without having to start an IV. This current quarter (Q3) we plan to reach out to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe to see if we can extend our services to Tribal members. Our focus will be assisting with patients who suffer from substance use and psychiatric disorders. Clallam Care Connection (3C) has grown from its original 4 member agencies to 8. 3C  provides coordinated care to improve the health status of individuals with complex, chronic conditions to deliver a seamless experience of care that is person-centered, cost effective, addresses social determinants of health, and results in improved health and wellness. Connecting weekly, providers from health, social service and community organizations are breaking the silos and moving towards whole-person care. 3C focuses on serving members of the community who are at risk for or experiencing: debilitating mental health and substance use disorder, repeat 911/emergency department use, risk of suicide, transition out of inpatient services or jail/prison; disjointed or discontinuous care."

Washington State had recently discontinued the COVID-19 emergency hold that kept utilities from being shut off and he was given a disconnection notification. We were able to keep his power on and helped him fill out LIHEAP paperwork through OlyCAP for assistance paying his outstanding bill. We also connected him with his family and local assistance to make sure he has food.

We have been working with this patient for almost three years. We helped get her into stable housing, assisted with finding her her own transportation, got her into treatment, and had her switch to a new PCP and psychiatric ARNP. She had a couple of relapses along the way, but she has been clean of illicit drugs for 15 months. She rarely calls 911 now and only uses the emergency department when it is appropriate.

Substance use disorder and behavioral health patients have required more of our program resources since the COVID-19 pandemic than anything else. Port Angeles accounts for over 70% of all overdoses in the county. We are taking steps to address this. It is best practice in more wealthy cities to administer Buprenorphine (when indicated) after overdoses or when the patient has been evaluated to be in moderate to severe withdrawals from opioids. Our intent is to develop our program to meet the need in this community by creating an acute- and post-overdose response team. We have identified and researched other programs that are successfully using this strategy.  We will model the team after this and adjust it to fit our community. We have spoken with medical leadership in our EMS region for advice in this area and they have responded very favorably and are excited about the idea. We will have more information by the end of 2023 and hope to operate under a new COP by the beginning of the year. We have found more educational resources for first responders in regard to best practice while responding to behavioral health crises. Our leadership is progressive and is allowing us to attend behavioral health seminars and educational opportunities that align with our mission. The Program Manager for LEAD Fire that was helping analyze data belonged to Olympic Peninsula Community Clinic. The position was vacated in June and has not been filled. We will not have the capacity to collect and analyze hospital readmission data without this resource."

Can't get him out to the vehicle to get him to doctor's appointments, etc. We found a resource in Bremerton with only two days notice of this patient's discharge that helped us procure an electric wheelchair, walker, lift chair, and electric hospital bed. We picked the equipment up, installed it in the patient's home, and educated them how to use it. There have been no 911 calls or ED visits to this address since the beginning of the quarter. She is able to get him to appointments and he is able to get around the house using the new tools."

          "response": "We spent the majority of this semester focused on research surrounding overdoses in Clallam County. We worked with our Medical Program Director, Dr. Craven and our Public Health Officer, Dr. Berry, we hope to develop a protocol that will allow Community Paramedics to administer Buprenorphine in the field. We determined approximately 70% of all overdose calls were in the city of Port Angeles district. Overdose fatalities almost doubled comparing previously recorded years. This is consistent when looking at similar data throughout the United States. We also understand that EMS may be the last and only entity that a patient experiencing overdose ever sees. There is absolutely no system in place for referral of these patients after they experience an overdose. Current Washington state legislation orders a person caught with an illegal substance be charged with a misdemeanor on the 3rd offense. It used to be a felony on the first offense. Other legislation makes it almost impossible for a law enforcement officer to be willing to ITA patients for fear of litigation. We saw only one case this year where a patient was detained under Ricky's Law and sent to treatment. We transport fewer than 40% of overdoses. The persons transported have been under implied consent or voluntary. It's also difficult to supervise treatment prior to EMS arrival. There are times when patients are given a great amount of Narcan and left on the street or in home with no supervision. We intend to make help more readily available to these patients in the field and home by responding to each overdose or following up with these patients after they have been identified by EMS crews. We will gather details about the event and refer to appropriate agencies that can provide support over the next 72 hours. This will allow us the opportunity to develop a relationship with these patients. If the patient will not agree to transport to the hospital, we will attempt to give them a ride to the shelter or some other safe place where they can be monitored. This reduces the likelihood of a secondary overdose resulting in death. We are creating a \"dashboard\" that anyone will be able to view PAFD Community Paramedicine and overdose specific statistics in the City of Port Angeles. Community Paramedics, and Police and Fire Chiefs will have the ability to view a heat map of overdoses and frequent 911 callers in our area of responsibility. We believe this will give us further insight and allow us to focus our, along with SUD/OUD support specialists, efforts to more specific areas and track transient behavior throughout the year. Heat map data will not be tied to PII. We will not be releasing this view to the public due to local incidents of violence directed at people experiencing homelessness."

We continue to participate in workgroups with the Coresponder Outreach Alliance (CROA) and be evaluated by the University of Washington in order to develop crisis response and de-escalation curricula for first responders. There is currently very little training available to first responders in regard to behavioral health and SUD cases. We are trained to manage medical & behavioral emergencies and not specifically how to manage a behavioral crisis. All of our ability to manage crises is developed through practical experience. There are no cookie-cutter protocols for handling every crisis. Having WA State mandated/approved trainings will give first responders the tools necessary to manage these types of calls and help destigmatize mental illness and substance use disorder. It will allow these patients greater access to the care they desperately need. Collateral work is being done to push legislation that would require WA State to allocate grant funding to coresponse programs."

She would never agree to further evaluation at the hospital or a clinic. She had a huge ulcer on her foot that we'd provide wound care for that would not heal. Eventually the ulcer became infected and she agreed to let us help her. We took pictures of the infection and discussed the case with a physician from the \"free clinic\" who allowed us to monitor her while administering antibiotics. She was distraught over her condition and being unable to walk and would break down crying each time we gave her antibiotics. We were able to use this to advantage by talking her into finally going to treatment for substance abuse. She has been in recovery for almost two years. She has stayed clean, healthy, and housed. She now volunteers time on the streets helping people find their way into recovery."

We know these numbers will fluctuate wildly throughout the year. The important thing is that we can very clearly see the benefit of engaging supportive services at the patient\u0092s point of crisis/contact rather than wait for them to reach out for help. We expect emergency response capable vehicles will allow us to respond to more overdoses, with the potential of responding to nearby County dispatches. We have met with each of the peer support agencies and MAT clinics so that we can better understand capabilities and form a plan to develop best practices when managing overdose cases. We are implementing weekly meetings to discuss cases between all the agencies managing SUD and patients that experience overdose. This will allow everyone to follow these cases as they progress."

[Patient] was interested in going to detox, reporting that the reason he had used was that he'd been hit by a car in Yakima 2 days before and was in terrible pain, exacerbated by withdrawal symptoms. Reflections put him up in a motel for the night. The next day we contacted North Olympic Healthcare Network (NOHN) to see if they could start micro-dosing Suboxone prior to intake with their OBOT program due to severe pain and danger of acute re-overdose. NOHN's OBOT met him at his PCP's clinic and got him started on Suboxone, which he currently on and is stabilized. He is currently waiting for a bed date and staying at a local motel. Reflections is checking on him daily. He has remained clean and he has made all his daily OBOT clinic appts. --- 50 Year-old Male w/ history of SUD (alcohol, amphetamines) & behavioral health disorders. We referred this patient to Reflections Counseling from the scene, who met him at the hospital. Once there, Reflections determined that he already had CM through PBH and called them - they then responded to the ED to follow up. [Patient] was held overnight in the ER and discharged to care of his case manager, from the PBH REAL team, the next day. She reports that was the first time he had tried fentanyl - he was drinking heavily and thought he was given methamphetamines, never intending to use opiates. He is back at his camp but comes to town to check in with his case manager every Thursday.

We had to demonstrate the need to key stakeholders in Port Angeles, including the Fire Chief, Police Chief, City Manager, City Council, County Health Officer, and EMS Medical Program Director. After presenting the data and potential solutions to city leadership, we identified the necessary steps to implement the PORT team and add MAT services to our program. This included petitioning the Washington State Health Department for permission to add a new drug to our EMS formulary. We also required an emergency response-capable vehicle equipped with ALS and Community Paramedic equipment, which is quite costly. Fortunately, we secured funding from two sources to acquire and outfit these vehicles. Another challenge over the past two years has been incorporating a Community Resource Officer from the Port Angeles Police Department into our team as an alternative to traditional law enforcement responses. Staffing fluctuations within the police department made it difficult to assign an experienced officer to this role. We are pleased to announce that this position has recently been filled, and the officer will respond to calls involving the transient population, low-acuity behavioral health, and substance use disorder cases."

We were hoping to push this along more quickly to get the EMTs hired in Quarter 2. It is difficult to move things quickly in a municipality. Administering Buprenorphine in the prehospital setting is new in Washington State. There are currently only 5 programs like ours that are in the process of implementing this. Only three programs have protocols signed and in place, approval from WA State, and have the medicine in supply. We have identified that we need to make significant changes to our protocols: Lower COWS score (Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale). It's currently at 8 and we intend to lower it to 5. Remove the restriction of not administering Buprenorphine if the overdose victim is being transported to the hospital. Remove the restriction of not administering Buprenorphine if the overdose victim is pregnant. Allow the CP to adjust the initial dose up to 24mg (from 4mg) to more quickly achieve the desired result. We have also identified that the hospital is not familiar with our protocols which makes a disjointed continuity of care for our patients. If we administer Buprenorphine, we essentially fix the withdrawal symptoms and there is no longer an emergency. We are in the process of streamlining the process between EMS, the hospital, and SUD professionals in order to be on the same page when treating this patient population."
