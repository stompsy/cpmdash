# Hargrove Grant — Metrics Insights (Plain Language)

**Document Version:** 4.2
**Last Updated:** January 30, 2026

This guide explains what the numbers on the Hargrove Grant report are *suggesting* about what’s happening in the community and in service delivery.

It’s written for general readers. It does not assume you know how the dashboard is built.

## How to read the report

### Quarter vs (YTD)

- **Quarter metrics** describe what happened during that 3‑month window.
- **(YTD) metrics** describe what has happened so far this year.

YTD will naturally change each quarter. Q4 is the only YTD that represents the full year.

### Activity vs reach

- **Activity** (encounters/contacts/referrals) shows how much work happened.
- **Reach** (unique people served) shows how many individuals were touched by that work.

If activity rises while reach stays flat, it often means more repeat follow‑up for the same group of people.

### “Up” and “down” are not automatically good or bad

Some measures are positive when they rise (successful connections to services). Others are concerning when they rise (overdoses).

The goal is to describe direction and meaning: **what moved, what it likely means, and what to watch next.**

## Helpful patterns to watch

### 1) Referral flow (received → initiated → resolved)

It helps to think of referrals as a simple flow:

- **Referrals received:** a request for help was recorded.
- **Referrals initiated:** steps were taken to connect someone to a service.
- **Resolution / follow‑up outcomes:** the situation was closed out or moved forward.

If “received” rises but “initiated” does not, common explanations include limited capacity, delays in documentation, or limited availability of outside services.

### 2) Intensity (contacts per person served)

One useful shorthand is:

$$\text{Contacts per person} = \frac{\text{Total Contacts}}{\text{People Served}}$$

When this increases, it usually means more repeat follow‑ups per person. That can reflect complex needs, difficulty accessing services, or more proactive outreach.

### 3) Service gaps (what people request most)

When the same services appear again and again (housing, detox, treatment access, behavioral health, primary care), it is a practical picture of what people are asking for most.

When one service dominates, it often means that need is especially hard to meet locally (long waitlists, limited capacity, or not enough options).

## Section-by-section insights

### Services Delivered

#### Total Contacts

What it means:

- Overall activity across encounters and referrals.

What to watch for:

- **Contacts up while people served is flat** → more repeat contact per person.
- **Contacts down while people served is flat** → fewer touches per person (this can be good, or it can reflect delayed documentation).

How to use it:

- Read this alongside “people served” to understand whether change is about *more people* or *more intensity*.

#### Referrals Received

What it means:

- Demand and inbound requests for help.

What to watch for:

- **Sudden spikes** can reflect a community event, a change in referral pathways, or better reporting.
- **Seasonality** is common; comparing the same quarter year‑over‑year is often more meaningful than comparing adjacent quarters.

#### Referrals Initiated

What it means:

- How often a referral moved from “recorded” to “action taken.”

What to watch for:

- **Initiated > received** can happen when older referrals are worked and completed this quarter.
- **Initiated << received** can indicate limited capacity, delays, or limited availability of outside services.

### Individuals Served

#### People Served

What it means:

- How many unique individuals had meaningful contact during the quarter.

What to watch for:

- **People served up, contacts flat** → more people reached, but fewer repeat touches per person.
- **People served flat, contacts up** → more repeat follow‑up for the same group.

#### New Enrollments

What it means:

- How many new individuals entered the system during the quarter.

What to watch for:

- **Enrollments up** with stable people served → higher turnover (more new people replacing prior ones).
- **Enrollments down** with higher repeat contact → more time spent on complex follow‑up for an existing group.

---

### Outcomes

#### Total Encounters

What it means:

- How many service contacts occurred.

What to watch for:

- **Encounters up** can mean proactive outreach, or it can mean repeated crisis/stability issues.
- Read alongside “people served” and any high‑utilizer indicators to understand whether activity is concentrated.

#### Overdose-related metrics

What it means:

- Overdose volume and follow‑up activity.

What to watch for:

- Repeat overdoses concentrated in a small group can indicate opportunities for targeted follow‑up.
- Sustained overdoses in a geography or living situation segment can suggest uneven risk across the community.

---

### Geographic Distribution

#### ZIP distribution

What it means:

- Where service demand is coming from geographically.

What to watch for:

- **ZIPs with rising share** even if totals are flat → shifting demand.
- **Small ZIPs with sharp spikes** may reflect a local incident or a reporting change.

---

### Service Gaps (requested services)

This section summarizes which services were requested most often.

Helpful reads:

- **Distinct services requested:** breadth of need.
- **Most common requested services:** demand hotspots.
- **People per service:** helps distinguish “many people need this” vs “a few people need this repeatedly.”

What to watch for:

- **One service dominating:** that need may be especially hard to meet in the current system.
- **Many services requested with small counts:** needs may be diverse and complex.

How to use it:

- Treat the top services as a short list of the most common unmet needs.

## Narrative: what good looks like

The narrative is where the numbers are explained in plain language:

- “What changed?” (the main movement)
- “Why did it change?” (the most likely reasons)
- “Why does it matter?” (impact)
- “What happens next?” (next steps)

Good narratives don’t just repeat the table. They explain what changed and why it matters.

---

## When the numbers can look odd

- **Documentation lag:** activity happened, but it was entered later.
- **Category drift:** categories are entered with slightly different names (creating messy buckets).
- **Carryover work:** referrals received in one quarter, then initiated/resolved in another.

If a quarter looks surprising:

1) Check whether it’s a real change or just delayed/messy data entry.
2) If it’s real, use the service-gap section and narrative to explain the most likely reasons.
