                    Community Paramedics in Port Angeles are leading a groundbreaking initiative to reduce opioid overdoses and provide compassionate, in-field care. By responding directly to overdose scenes, offering medication-assisted treatment, and linking survivors to long-term recovery services, they're transforming crisis moments into pathways toward hope and healing.

                    Through trusted partnerships with PAPD, ReDiscovery, Reflections Counseling, and others, CPMs coordinate services that save lives and relieve pressure on emergency units. Their work exemplifies how public safety-led outreach can turn a moment of crisis into a turning point toward recovery.

                <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-200/90">
                    Operation Shielding Hope represents a shift in how our city responds to addiction. It's a model rooted in empathy, connection, and evidence-based care—and it's working. With your continued support, Port Angeles is not only confronting the opioid crisis, but leading the way with a public health-driven solution.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-3xl">Opioid Settlement Funds</h2>
                <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-200/90">
                    In May of 2022, Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced a $518 million settlement with several major opioid distributors aimed at resolving opioid-related claims. Following City Council approval on July 5, 2023, approximately $1.8M of these funds will be allocated to the City of Port Angeles over the next 18 years to address the opioid crisis, including substance use treatment, access to overdose-reversal drugs, and services to assist with those struggling with addiction.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-3xl">Goals and Scope</h2>
                <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-200/90">
                    The City's goal when distributing these funds is to reduce the impact to public safety services, healthcare facilities, local businesses, and our City residents and visitors through effective and strategic measures, such as treatment, prevention, and education on opioid use and abuse.
